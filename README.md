# pokemon-style-game

Added basic game assets
Open tiled map editor
Create 70 by 40, 12px each game map
Select and highlight water tile (9x9), select random(dice) and fill tile(bucket) and fill map with water
Water will be our base layer where all other layers will stack on it
Rename tile to Water
Create tile layer 2 and rename it to island
In this layer we are placing land on top of the water
Pick the land mass that has a water border(to indicate that land is on water) and put it on the map
On this land mass, pick a tile on the island and expand it upwards
Pick the middle left border(because it is optimized to be connected), and expand the left border
Do the same for the right
With both sides done, practice using the top side of the land mass border
Remember the corners of the land mass are always different as they are connecting between corners and thus have a different shape
The green tile has some grass portion tilesets for the outward-most tiles, use those(remember there are middle and corner tiles) and fill the edges up
Expand this 'island' land mass as much as you like
Moving on, we will be placing a plateau on top of the island you just create
Create tile layer 3 and rename it to Plateau
Now take the land mass with grass borders and place on top of your island
Trim it down to fit the island so your character could visibly move without obstruction
Create tile layer 4 and rename it to House
Now place a house in an empty space
You should be running out of space now
You can click island, highlight(right click and drag or use the rectangle tool) a portion of the map you wanna expand, hit control + c, and replicate that portion
With your island expanded, you can create tile layer 5 and rename it to Trees
Notice when you layer your trees in the same tileset, the empty spaces you highlighted from the tileset.png removes parts of the tree when you try to stack them
To layer the trees you want to put them in different tile layers
So you could name the upper layer Trees 1, and the rest trees 2 and so on to layer them properly and give them a 'dense' feeling
Now we want the path from the entrance of the house to the stairs of the plateau
Create a new tile layer and rename it to Paths
You have sand paths and grass with sand edges
Use sand paths to pathways, and the grass with sand edges to make the sand paths 'merge' with the grass
With the path done, add a new tile layer and rename it to battle patch
These dark grass will be where battles happen randomly when a character walk through them
With the patch done, add a new tile layer and rename it to Grass and Flowers
Highlight, randomise them and place them on the green tiles
After Grass and Flowers, add another layer and call it Fence
After Fence, do another layer called Dock(with the boat)
We will now deal with collisions which will dictate borders character cannot move pass
Download collision.png(just a red tilebox) and place in your Game Asset folder
Create a new tileset in your map editor for this collision image just like your asset png for your 12x12 tileset
Now, add a new tile layer called Collisions
In that layer, you can place the red squares in areas you think the players should not be able to move on
With your collision areas done, we will now deal with foreground layers
Notice that for your house, your character should be able to walk behind the house and not get block by the rooftop that is protruding upwards
Add a new tile layer called Foreground Layers
In that Foreground layers tileset, you want to place all foreground elements(such as that protruding rooftop) ONTO ITSELF(i.e you click house layer, copy that protruding roof area, go to Foreground layers, and paste that onto that protruding roof area again)
These foreground layers will be placed on top of your characters later down the road(very much later me thinks), so when a character walk pass these foreground layers, it will create the effect that the character is walking behind these foreground layers
Other foreground layers include that top bit of your fence, top bit of your trees, TOP BIT OF WHATEVER YOUR CHARACTER WALKS BEHIND etc
Now we are going to expand the whole island so it looks like an island(you can use the author's map or create your own)
