# pokemon-style-game

Added basic game assets
Open tiled map editor
Create 70 by 40, 12px each game map
Select and highlight water tile (9x9), select random(dice) and fill tile(bucket) and fill map with water
Water will be our base layer where all other layers will stack on it
Rename tile to Water
Create tile layer 2
In this layer we are placing land on top of the water
Pick the land mass that has a water border(to indicate that land is on water) and put it on the map
On this land mass, pick a tile on the island and expand it upwards
Pick the middle left border(because it is optimized to be connected), and expand the left border
Do the same for the right
With both sides done, practice using the top side of the land mass border
Remember the corners of the land mass are always different as they are connecting between corners and thus have a different shape
The green tile has some grass portion tilesets for the outward-most tiles, use those(remember there are middle and corner tiles) and fill the edges up
Expand this 'island' land mass as much as you like
Moving on, we will be placing a land mass on top of the land mass you just created(land-massception)
